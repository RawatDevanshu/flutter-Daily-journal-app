# daily_journal

This daily journal Flutter app was developed to help users record and manage their daily thoughts and experiences. The app was <b>built with the Firebase</b>, which provides cloud-based backend services and makes it easy to build and scale apps. <b>The app has four pages: authentication, home, and create journal and display journal.</b> The authentication page allows users to log in if they have an existing account or sign up if they are new users. The home page displays a list of the user's journal entries and has a drawer with simple user details and a sign out button. The create journal page provides a form for users to create a new journal entry and display journal page displays the date and data in the journal and allows the user to delete the journal if needed Firebase authentication and Firebase Firestore cloud storage were used to perform user authentication, sign up, logout and to store journal entries, respectively. The app was tested on an emulator and physical device and was found to be functional
